## Packages

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="@usels/core" icon="puzzle">
    Observable-native hooks for DOM and browser interaction — element refs, resize, intersection, scroll, mouse, media queries, and more. Every hook accepts `Ref$` for reactive element targeting.
  </Card>
  <Card title="@usels/integrations" icon="rocket">
    third-party integration built for Legend-State
  </Card>
  <Card title="@usels/vite-plugin-legend-memo" icon="setting">
    Vite plugin that automatically wraps `obs$.get()` calls in JSX with `<Memo>` at build time — no manual wrapping needed. Place before `@vitejs/plugin-react` in your config.
  </Card>
  <Card title="@usels/babel-plugin-legend-memo" icon="seti:config">
    Babel plugin that transforms `obs$.get()` into fine-grained `<Memo>` boundaries. Use directly with babel or via the Vite plugin wrapper.
